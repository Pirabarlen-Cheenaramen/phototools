# phototools
Just a sample django 1.9 and python3 project to show django's internal urls,models, views and template at work. This project allows a user to upload a picture and then it converts the image into grayscale before submitting that to the user. NO CLEANUP of those pictures are done. No frontend beautification has been done.
